### 2. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
**Location**: [documentation/architecture/decisions/](architecture/decisions/)

Three initial ADRs documenting key architectural decisions:
- **ADR-0001**: Use Vue 3 for Frontend Framework
- **ADR-0002**: Use SQLite for Data Storage
- **ADR-0003**: Use Vitest for Testing

Plus an ADR template for future decisions.

### 3. Architecture Overview
**File**: [documentation/architecture/overview.md](architecture/overview.md)

A detailed technical overview including:
- System architecture diagrams
- Component descriptions
- Data flow documentation
- Database schema
- Development workflow
- Performance characteristics

### 4. Updated README
**File**: [README.md](../README.md)

Enhanced with:
- Links to architecture documentation
- Contributing guidelines
- License information
- Architecture documentation index

## Key Findings

2. **Good test coverage** with 26 passing tests
3. **Modern technology stack** (Vue 3, Vite, Express 5)
4. **Component-based architecture** for maintainability
5. **Clean API design** with RESTful endpoints

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

#### High Priority (7 items)
1. Fix ESLint configuration (migrate to flat config)
2. Address security vulnerabilities (npm audit)
3. Implement standardized error handling
4. Create OpenAPI specification for API
5. Increase test coverage (add missing tests)
6. Security hardening (helmet, CORS, validation)
7. This architecture documentation ✅ (COMPLETED)

#### Medium Priority (8 items)
8. Reorganize code structure (move DataService to /services)
9. Add configuration management (environment-based)
10. Create SDK/Client library (reusable npm package)
11. Add integration tests
12. Implement API versioning
13. Add caching layer
14. Enhanced README ✅ (COMPLETED)

#### Low Priority (6 items)
15. Restructure backend (feature-based organization)
16. Add TypeScript (gradual migration)
17. Create test data builders
18. Plugin architecture
19. Data source abstraction
20. Monitoring & logging

- Fix ESLint and security issues
- Set up ADR process ✅

### Phase 2: Quality & Testing (Weeks 3-4)
- Add missing tests
- Implement error handling
- Create API documentation

### Phase 3: Structure & Organization (Weeks 5-6)
- Reorganize code
- Security hardening
- Integration tests

### Phase 4: Extensibility (Weeks 7-8)
- Client SDK
- API versioning
- Caching

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Weeks 9+)
- Plugin architecture
- Data source abstraction
- Monitoring

## Metrics & Statistics

### Documentation Created
- **Total Files**: 8 new files
- **Total Lines**: ~1,200 lines of documentation
- **Main Document**: 500+ lines (ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **ADRs**: 3 detailed records
- **Templates**: 2 reusable templates

### Coverage Analysis
- ✅ Code Structure & Organization: Comprehensive
- ✅ Testing Architecture: Comprehensive
- ✅ Documentation: Comprehensive
- ✅ Collaboration & Extensibility: Comprehensive
- ✅ Security & Performance: Included
- ✅ Actionable Recommendations: 20 items prioritized

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. Review this assessment with the team
2. Prioritize which recommendations to implement first
3. Fix ESLint configuration issue
4. Run `npm audit fix` to address security vulnerabilities

### Short-term Actions (This Month)
5. Implement standardized error handling
6. Add missing unit tests (DataService, db.js, rateLimiter)
7. Create OpenAPI specification for the API
8. Begin security hardening (helmet, CORS)

### Long-term Actions (This Quarter)
9. Reorganize code structure
10. Create client SDK library
11. Implement API versioning
12. Add integration and E2E tests
