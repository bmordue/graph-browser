# ADR-0001: Use Vue 3 for Frontend Framework

**Date:** 2023-01-01 (Retroactive)  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Project Team  
**Consulted:** N/A  
**Informed:** All Developers

## Context

The Graph Browser application requires a modern frontend framework to build an interactive, responsive user interface for browsing graph data. The application needs to:

- Display and navigate hierarchical graph structures
- Update UI efficiently when users select different nodes
- Maintain state across multiple connected list components
- Provide good developer experience and maintainability

### Problem Statement
Select a frontend framework that enables rapid development of an interactive graph browsing interface while maintaining good performance and developer productivity.

### Constraints
- Must support modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Should have good component composition capabilities
- Needs reactive data binding for dynamic updates
- Should integrate well with Vite build tool
- Community support and documentation availability

### Assumptions
- The application will be primarily used in modern browsers
- The graph data structures are not extremely large (thousands, not millions of nodes)
- Developer familiarity with JavaScript frameworks

## Decision

We will use **Vue 3** as the frontend framework for the Graph Browser application, utilizing both the Options API and Composition API as appropriate.

### Proposed Solution
Implement the frontend using:
- **Vue 3.x** as the core framework
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server
- **Vue Test Utils** with Vitest for component testing
- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns

### Rationale
1. **Progressive Framework**: Vue can be adopted incrementally and doesn't require a complex setup
2. **Excellent Documentation**: Vue has comprehensive, well-written documentation
3. **Performance**: Vue 3's reactivity system is highly optimized
4. **Developer Experience**: Intuitive API, good tooling (Vue DevTools), and helpful error messages
5. **Component System**: Excellent support for component composition and reusability
6. **Vite Integration**: First-class support for Vite, providing fast development experience
7. **Smaller Learning Curve**: Compared to other frameworks, easier for new developers to onboard

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: React
**Description:** Use React with JSX and hooks for building the UI

**Pros:**
- Largest ecosystem and community
- Extensive third-party libraries
- Strong industry adoption
- Excellent tooling

**Cons:**
- Steeper learning curve, especially hooks and context
- More boilerplate code required
- JSX syntax may be less intuitive for some developers
- Requires additional libraries for state management (Redux, MobX)

**Why rejected:** While React is excellent, Vue provides a more approachable API for this project's scope, and the template syntax is more familiar to HTML/CSS developers.

### Alternative 2: Svelte
**Description:** Use Svelte, a compile-time framework that shifts work to build step

**Pros:**
- Excellent performance (no virtual DOM)
- Minimal boilerplate
- Reactive by default
- Small bundle sizes

**Cons:**
- Smaller ecosystem compared to Vue/React
- Less mature tooling and IDE support
- Smaller community, fewer learning resources
- Less enterprise adoption

**Why rejected:** While Svelte is innovative, Vue's larger ecosystem, better tooling, and more extensive documentation make it a safer choice for long-term maintainability.

### Alternative 3: Vanilla JavaScript
**Description:** Build the application using plain JavaScript without a framework

**Pros:**
- No framework dependencies
- Maximum flexibility
- Smallest possible bundle size
- Complete control over implementation

**Cons:**
- Much more code to write and maintain
- Need to implement own reactivity system
- More complex state management
- Higher risk of bugs
- Less standardized code structure

**Why rejected:** The complexity of managing reactive updates and component state makes a framework approach more practical for this interactive application.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster Development**: Vue's intuitive API accelerates feature development
- **Better Maintainability**: Component-based architecture makes code easier to understand and modify
- **Reactive Updates**: Automatic UI updates when data changes reduce manual DOM manipulation
- **Good Performance**: Vue 3's optimizations ensure smooth user experience
- **Testing Support**: Vue Test Utils provides excellent component testing capabilities
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Developers enjoy working with Vue's clean API

### Negative
- **Framework Lock-in**: Switching to another framework would require significant rewrite
- **Learning Curve**: Developers unfamiliar with Vue need to learn the framework
- **Bundle Size**: Framework adds ~30-40KB (gzipped) to bundle size
- **Build Process**: Requires build tooling (Vite) rather than simple script tags

### Neutral
- **Options API vs Composition API**: Having two styles may cause inconsistency if not managed
- **TypeScript Integration**: While Vue 3 has good TypeScript support, it's not required

## Implementation

### Action Items
- [x] Set up Vite with Vue 3 plugin
- [x] Create component structure (GraphBrowser, ConnectedList, NodeDetails, NodeHistory)
- [x] Implement DataService for API communication
- [x] Set up Vitest for component testing
- [x] Configure Vue DevTools for development

### Timeline
Completed in initial project setup

### Dependencies
- Vite build tool
- Vue 3 core library
- @vue/test-utils for testing
- Axios for HTTP requests

### Risks
- **Risk**: Team unfamiliarity with Vue
  - **Mitigation**: Documentation, code reviews, knowledge sharing sessions
- **Risk**: Framework updates breaking existing code
  - **Mitigation**: Pin dependencies, test updates in separate branch, follow Vue's migration guides

## Validation

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Interactive graph browsing works smoothly
- ✅ Components are reusable and maintainable
- ✅ Tests provide good coverage of component behavior
- ✅ Development velocity is high
- ✅ UI updates are performant (no noticeable lag)

### Review Date
2024-01-01 (Annual review of technology choices)

## Notes

Vue 3's Composition API is available for use in future components where it provides clearer code organization, but the Options API remains the default to maintain consistency with existing components.

The decision to use Vue over React was also influenced by the project maintainer's preference and existing experience, which is a valid consideration for solo/small team projects.
